# Graphic Layout Generation

## Introduction
This is a collection of repositories for graphic layout generation. Graphic layout is the arrangement of visual elements. Graphic layout generation aims at generating aesthetically pleasing layouts based on diverse user requirements. 

We mainly focus on three critical topics in graphic layout generation.

- Capture characteristics of graphic layouts: [Coarse-to-Fine](https://github.com/microsoft/LayoutGeneration/tree/main/Coarse-to-Fine) and [LayoutDiffusion](https://github.com/microsoft/LayoutGeneration/tree/main/LayoutDiffusion).
- Model user requirements: [Parse-then-Place](https://github.com/microsoft/LayoutGeneration/tree/main/Parse-Then-Place).
- Unify different tasks: [LayoutFormer++](https://github.com/microsoft/LayoutGeneration/tree/main/LayoutFormer%2B%2B) and [LayoutPrompter](https://github.com/microsoft/LayoutGeneration/tree/main/LayoutPrompter).
